This is a script meant to help practise passing traffic. Run Traffic.exe to display a window containing a circle and two lines.  On each line is a PPS representing an aircraft and each PPS will have a data tag next to it containing: ACID, aircraft type, altitude, and speed as would be shown on your CSiT.  Clicking anywhere in the window will draw a new scenario.  The program will take longer to start the first time you run it.
