This is a script meant to help practise passing traffic.  Run Traffic.exe to display a window containing a circle and two lines.  On each line is a PPS representing an aircraft and each PPS will have a data tag next to it containing: ACID, aircraft type, altitude, and speed as would be shown on your CSiT.  Clicking anywhere in the window will draw a new scenario.  The program will take longer to start the first time you run it. 

There are no plans to include a "correction", as the correct answer should be easy enough to determine with a little work. The point of course is to give the student an easy way to see many different scenarios to practise speed and accuracy. 

Comments, suggestions, and bug reports are appreciated.
